## Steps Involved in Analysis

### 1. Data Preparation

Before performing any analysis, the dataset needs to be cleaned and formatted properly. The steps involved include:
- No missing and duplicated values were found.
- Formatting date columns to ensure proper time series analysis.
- Creating new columns [ higlighted by Green color] such as calculating the "Delivery Time" from Order Date to Ship Date, profit margin etc.

#### Descriptive Analysis

##### Sales and Profit Analysis by Subcategory

Sales and profit analysis by subcategory provides a clear understanding of how each product subcategory is performing in terms of revenue and profitability.

- **Chairs** emerges as the top revenue generator, contributing **$328,449.10** in sales, while **Copiers** stands out as the most profitable subcategory, with **$55,617.82** in profit.

- Some subcategories, such as **Supplies** (**$46,673.54** in sales, **-$1,189.10** in profit) and **Tables** (**$206,965.53** in sales, **-$17,725.48** in profit), show negative profits, highlighting underperformance and areas for potential reassessment.

- Despite these losses, the overall profit across all subcategories remains strong at **$286,397.02**, driven by high-performing categories like **Binders** (**$203,412.73** in sales, **$30,221.76** in profit), **Phones** (**$330,007.05** in sales, **$44,515.73** in profit), and **Storage** (**$223,843.61** in sales, **$21,278.83** in profit), which significantly contribute to both sales and profit.

- Additionally, subcategories like **Art** (**$27,118.79** in sales, **$6,527.79** in profit) and **Envelopes** (**$16,476.40** in sales, **$6,964.18** in profit), although generating lower sales, maintain strong profit margins, suggesting they are niche but high-margin items.

This analysis provides valuable insights into which product subcategories are driving overall business performance and which areas require further attention and strategic improvement.

### Recommendations

To optimize business performance and profitability, it is recommended to focus on high-performing subcategories such as **Chairs**, **Phones**, and **Copiers** by prioritizing their marketing and inventory management. These subcategories are contributing significantly to overall sales and profits, and increasing their visibility can drive further revenue growth.

For underperforming subcategories like **Supplies** and **Tables**, a thorough evaluation of pricing strategies, promotions, or potential product replacements is necessary. Addressing these areas can help mitigate losses and improve profitability.

Additionally, products with high profit margins but lower sales, such as **Art** and **Envelopes**, should be promoted more strategically to capitalize on their profitability. By increasing their sales volume, the business can further enhance its overall profit margins.

Cross-selling opportunities for products with high sales but lower margins, like **Phones** and **Binders**, could further improve profit. This approach can help increase the profitability of existing products while enhancing the customer experience.

Finally, diversifying product offerings in successful categories such as **Chairs** and **Storage** would also be beneficial. Expanding these high-performing categories can help the business capture more market share and create new revenue streams.

Implementing these strategies will help increase profitability, streamline inventory management, and ensure long-term growth.
