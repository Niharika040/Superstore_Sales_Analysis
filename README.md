# Superstore_Sales_Analysis


## Project Overview
This project is an **exploratory and descriptive analysis** of the **Superstore Dataset**, sourced from **Kaggle**. The dataset provides rich insights into business operations, including sales, profit, customer segmentation, and regional performance. The analysis leverages advanced **Excel tools**, including Pivot Tables, Data Visualizations, and Formula-based calculations, to uncover hidden patterns and key metrics that drive business performance. The primary goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights that can help in strategic decision-making across various aspects of the business.

 
The dataset contain following key attributes:
- **Row ID**: A unique identifier for each row in the dataset.
- **Order ID**: A unique identifier for each order.
- **Order Date**: The date when the order was placed.
- **Ship Date**: The date when the order was shipped.
- **Customer ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Customer Name**: The name of the customer.
- **Segment**: The segment to which the customer belongs (e.g., Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).

## Steps Involved in Analysis

### 1. Data Preparation

Before performing any analysis, the dataset needs to be cleaned and formatted properly. The steps involved include:
- No missing and duplicated values were found.
- Formatting date columns to ensure proper time series analysis.
- Creating new columns [highlighted by Green color] such as calculating the "Delivery Time" from Order Date to Ship Date, profit margin, etc.

**Insights from Descriptive Analysis and Interpretation**

    - The comprehensive analysis of the Superstore dataset reveals valuable insights across subcategories, categories, shipping modes, customer segments, regional performance, and the impact of discounts on sales and profit margins.

   - Subcategory analysis highlights significant disparities in performance. While Copiers, Paper, and Labels demonstrate exceptional profitability with profit margins exceeding 40%, categories like Tables (-9%) and Supplies (-3%) generate losses despite moderate sales volumes, indicating operational inefficiencies or misaligned pricing strategies.
     
   - The Technology category dominates overall sales, contributing 36.4% of total revenue, closely followed by Furniture (32.3%) and Office Supplies (31.3%), reflecting diverse customer preferences. However, low-performing subcategories such as Machines and Bookcases present opportunities for reevaluation and repositioning.

   - Shipping modes show varying utilization and profitability. Standard Class is the most utilized, contributing the majority of sales, whereas First Class and Same Day services, despite their smaller share, exhibit higher profitability, suggesting potential for premium targeting. In customer segmentation, the Consumer segment accounts for over 50% of orders, but there is untapped potential in the Corporate and Home Office segments, which could benefit from customized offerings.

   - Regional analysis underscores the dominance of states like California, Texas, and New York, which are the largest revenue contributors. Conversely, states like Wyoming and West Virginia exhibit minimal sales activity, representing untapped market opportunities. The correlation between regions, shipping modes, and customer segments could be leveraged to enhance performance in underperforming areas.

  - Discount analysis reveals a direct impact on profitability. Excessive discounting in categories like Tables and Furniture correlates with significant profit erosion, emphasizing the need for more strategic discount management. Subcategories like Envelopes, Paper, and Labels, which maintain high-profit margins despite discounts, highlight opportunities to balance value and profitability.

  - Lastly, the analysis of total quantity ordered reinforces the dominance of Office Supplies, accounting for 60% of total quantities, but with relatively low margins. This contrasts with the high-margin contributions of the Technology category, which, despite lower quantities, significantly bolsters overall profitability.
