## Steps Involved in Analysis

### 1. Data Preparation
Before performing any analysis, the dataset needs to be cleaned and formatted properly. The steps involved include:
- No missing and duplicated values were found.
- Formatting date columns to ensure proper time series analysis.
- Creating new columns [ higlighted by Green color] such as calculating the "Delivery Time" from Order Date to Ship Date, profit margin etc.
