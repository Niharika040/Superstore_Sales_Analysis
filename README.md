## Steps Involved in Analysis

### 1. Data Preparation

Before performing any analysis, the dataset needs to be cleaned and formatted properly. The steps involved include:
- No missing and duplicated values were found.
- Formatting date columns to ensure proper time series analysis.
- Creating new columns [highlighted by Green color] such as calculating the "Delivery Time" from Order Date to Ship Date, profit margin, etc.

**Insights from Descriptive Analysis and Interpretation**

   - The comprehensive analysis of the Superstore dataset reveals valuable insights across subcategories, categories, shipping modes, customer segments, regional performance, and the impact of discounts on sales and profit margins.

   - Subcategory analysis highlights significant disparities in performance. While Copiers, Paper, and Labels demonstrate exceptional profitability with profit margins exceeding 40%, categories like Tables (-9%) and Supplies (-3%) generate losses despite moderate sales volumes, indicating operational inefficiencies or misaligned pricing strategies.
     
   - The Technology category dominates overall sales, contributing 36.4% of total revenue, closely followed by Furniture (32.3%) and Office Supplies (31.3%), reflecting diverse customer preferences. However, low-performing subcategories such as Machines and Bookcases present opportunities for reevaluation and repositioning.

   - Shipping modes show varying utilization and profitability. Standard Class is the most utilized, contributing the majority of sales, whereas First Class and Same Day services, despite their smaller share, exhibit higher profitability, suggesting potential for premium targeting. In customer segmentation, the Consumer segment accounts for over 50% of orders, but there is untapped potential in the Corporate and Home Office segments, which could benefit from customized offerings.

   - Regional analysis underscores the dominance of states like California, Texas, and New York, which are the largest revenue contributors. Conversely, states like Wyoming and West Virginia exhibit minimal sales activity, representing untapped market opportunities. The correlation between regions, shipping modes, and customer segments could be leveraged to enhance performance in underperforming areas.

  - Discount analysis reveals a direct impact on profitability. Excessive discounting in categories like Tables and Furniture correlates with significant profit erosion, emphasizing the need for more strategic discount management. Subcategories like Envelopes, Paper, and Labels, which maintain high-profit margins despite discounts, highlight opportunities to balance value and profitability.

  - Lastly, the analysis of total quantity ordered reinforces the dominance of Office Supplies, accounting for 60% of total quantities, but with relatively low margins. This contrasts with the high-margin contributions of the Technology category, which, despite lower quantities, significantly bolsters overall profitability.

**Insights from Time-based Analysis and Interpretation**

- **Sales Peak in the Last Quarter:** Sales tend to be highest in the **last quarter** of the year (October, November, December), particularly in **2016** and **2017**.
- **November Sales Spike:** There is a consistent **spike in sales in November** across all years, likely due to **Black Friday** and **holiday shopping**.
- **Same Day and First Class Delivery:** The quickest delivery options are **Same Day (0 days)** and **First Class (2 days)**, which are ideal for customers seeking **fast deliveries**.
- **Second Class and Standard Class Delivery:** These options have **longer average times** (3 and 5 days, respectively), which may negatively impact **customer satisfaction** and **sales**, particularly during **peak seasons**.


 **Sales Performance vs. Delivery Time**

- **2014:** Sales were moderate at $484K, and Standard Class delivery time was 5 days, which could have led to slower customer responses during peak months.

- **2015:** Sales dropped slightly to $470K, potentially due to the 5-day delivery of Standard Class, which in a competitive market could have deterred customers. While Same Day delivery (0 days) would have been optimal, it was likely not as common.
- **2016:** Sales rose to $609K, correlating with the availability of faster delivery options (e.g., Same Day and First Class), which likely enhanced customer satisfaction.
- **2017:** Sales peaked at $733K, aligning with the increased availability of quick delivery options across regions. November saw the highest sales, where faster delivery likely played a key role.
  
**Monthly Sales vs. Delivery Times:**

- **January - March:** Sales were lower during these months, likely due to post-holiday spending drops. Delivery times across regions remained consistent with Standard Class (5 days) being the dominant option, though Same Day (0 days) and First Class (2 days) were likely less common during these slower months.
  
- **April - September:** Sales were moderate, with delivery times still hovering between 2 and 5 days. There was no noticeable surge in sales, but Same Day and First Class deliveries could potentially boost sales during these mid-year lulls.
  
- **October - December:** Sales peaked, especially in November and December. During these busy months, faster delivery options (Same Day, First Class) likely became more critical. Faster delivery options seemed to correlate with higher sales, as customers prioritized quick shipments during the holiday season.
